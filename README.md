# SecureVision Project

**Student ID:** 210296620

**Project Name:** SecureVision

***

## System Information 

The project was developed with following technologies.

- Operating System: MacOS Ventura 13.6.4 (c)

- Source-code Editor: Visual Studio Code

- Python Version: Python 3.10.9

- Flask version: Flask 2.3.0

- Database: SQLite3

- API: Gmail API v1 and Google Drive API

*** 

## Browser Compatibility 

If you are using the Chrome browser, you must manually enable microphone and video in Chrome Settings. This is due to the localhost not being a secure host. Chrome requires HTTPS. To enable camera and microphone, navigate to the  [Chrome settings page](chrome://settings/content/siteDetails?site=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A5003).

#### Note: The project was only tested with Chrome and Safari.

## Project Setup and Installation using Terminal:

1. Unzip the project folder

2. Navigate to the project directory
	    
        cd [ADD YOUR DIRECTORY HERE]

3. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.10.9)
	
        /usr/local/bin/python3.10 -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment

        source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the dependencies
	
        pip install --use-pep517 -r requirements.txt

6. Verifying Installed Packages
	
        pip list

*Note that if "object-detection==0.1" appears in the requirements.txt, you will be unable to install dependencies.Â This could happen if you installed dependencies, added more, and then ran pip freeze > requirements.txt. This will include "object-detection==0.1", which will prevent you from installing dependencies from that file again. If this happens, manually remove "object-detection==0.1" from requirements.txt and try again.*


7. TensorFlow Model Setup

    *The TensorFlow model must run at all times. You must run TensorFlow before starting development server.*

Navigate to the TensorFlow models research directory:
	
    cd models/research

Compile Protocol Buffers:
	
    protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.

Set the PYTHONPATH:

	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim

Verify Object Detection API Setup:
	
    python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py

Remember to navigate back to the correct folder (twice):
	    
    cd ..
